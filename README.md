# openapi-lib-generator

A tool to generate Rust libraries from OpenAPI specifications using the [OpenAPI Generator Rust code generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/rust/).

## About
It is available as a binary or library.

## Is this tool worth it?
There are other tools like this:

- [openapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi_generator)
- [openapi-client-generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi-client-generator)
- [oapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/oapi_generator) 

This differs from those by trying to generate self-updatable crates that include [cargo-make makefiles](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) so as not to have to keep using this generator. 

### Goal
Any crate generated by this generator should be mostly self-maintainable, including in its makefile all of the commands necessary to self-update to new versions as needed.

### Progress

This tool can indeed generate code. There are, however, problems with the OpenAPI Generator's Rust generator.

As of now, there may be errors in the generated code. (Notably, [rustc error code e0412 (A used type name is not in scope)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0412.html)) There are PR requests pending on that repo to fix these problems, but the maintainers seem really busy.  

As of now, the generated code will be Rust 2018 edition. See the generated makefile for a task that tries to fix this, but the generated Cargo toml will require a manual update of the `package.edition` field.
